CS 330 Final Project – Portfolio Reflection

For this project, I created a 3D kitchen counter scene with a cutting board and a two-part knife. I used shapes, textures, lighting, and camera controls to build a fully interactive OpenGL environment. The final result brought together everything I learned in the course.

How do I approach designing software?
I break the work into parts and build in layers. For this project, I started with object placement, then added textures, camera movement, and finally lighting. Feedback helped me improve lighting and visibility.

What new design or development skills did I learn?
I learned how much lighting affects realism and how to use ambient and diffuse light effectively. I also practiced writing cleaner, reusable code using helper functions like SetTransformations().

How did iteration help?
I constantly tested and adjusted—especially with lighting and camera behavior. Each milestone helped refine the scene a little more.

How can I use these skills in the future?
Understanding how 3D graphics work gives me a strong base for future projects in game design, simulation, or even UI work. It also showed me how important visual design and structure are in any interactive program.
